This is a project developed in the course "Internet and Multimedia Laboratory" at University of Padova.
For more information, see the report document.


1. TOOLBOXES REQUIRED:

- Image Processing Toolbox
- Symbolic Math Toolbox
- Instrument Control Toolbox
- Variable Precision Integer (from Matlab Central File Exchange). NOTE: for the correct execution, after the download of the toolbox, you need to change the name of the VPI package 'powermod.m' function into 'vpi_powermod.m'.


2. HOW TO RUN THE CODE:

- Script to execute are in 'src' directory
- Open 2 instances of Matlab
- On one instance: run the script 'server_main.m'
- On the other instance: run the script 'main.m'
- 6 figures should appear, 3 from the client and 3 from the server.


3. IF SOME ERROR OCCURES:

- Change the port number: line 84 in 'main.m', line 6 in 'server_main.m'
- Run as from step 2 in section 2.
